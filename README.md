# Cluster Analysis
K-Means Cluster analysis on Iris dataset in Scikit.     
Predicting the optimum number of cluster from the data. Here, I am using cluster analysis on Iris data set in Scikit learn. The data set consist of 150 samples which is taken from three species of flowers Iris-Setosa, Iris-Virginica, and Iris-Versicolor. Four featurs were measured from each sample includes the length and width of the sepals and petals.

In this project I have using K-means clustering method.

These are the steps for that:-    
   1.Import the data set  
   2.Visualising    
   3.Finding the optimum number of clusters    
   4.Applying K-Means clustering on the data   
   5.Visualize the clusters
